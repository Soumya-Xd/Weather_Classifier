Weather Classifier Web App

# Description

This is a Weather Classifier web application that classifies images of various weather conditions and provides the result along with the confidence score and precautions.

# Model Overview

The Weather Classifier uses a deep learning model trained on a diverse dataset of weather images to identify different weather conditions. The model can classify the following weather types:

Dew
Foggy
Frost
Glaze
Hail
Lightning
Rain
Rainbow
Rime
Sandstorm
Snow
Cloudy
Sunshine

The model was trained using a convolutional neural network (CNN) which is well-suited for image classification tasks. The dataset used for training is sourced from Kaggle and contains a comprehensive collection of weather images.

# App Features

Upload or Capture Image: Users can upload an image from their device or capture a new image using their webcam.
